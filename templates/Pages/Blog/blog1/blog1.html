			<h1>What is web hosting and domains?</h1>
			
			<h3>What is a server?</h3>
			<p>
                You might have seen in movies these big rooms with corridors made of blocks with hundreds of flashy indicators on them. 
                What they didn't tell you is that these are big computers that every online service or a website relies on. These are called servers.
                A server is a piece of computer hardware, which provides functionality for other clients (programs or devices). 
                This functionality often called "services". The types of services we're talking about here are: sharing data or resources among multiple
                clients or performing computation for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers.
                A client makes a request to a server and a server serves the client by responding to the client's request. Servers, among other things, 
                store websites. Technically, every time you access a website you, as a client, make a request to a server which stores the website you're 
                trying to access. A server responds by delivering the webpages to you through your browser.
            </p>

				Servers, among other things, store websites.
            </q>

			<h3>What is web hosting?</h3>
			<p>
                As a service web hosting allows you to post your website onto the Internet. A web host is a business that provides the technologies and
                services needed for the website or webpage to be viewed on the Internet. A web host owns and maintains servers that have to be on 24/7 so
                that your website is always available. You can purchase your server and keep it at home, but apart of paying for your server, you will need
                to deal with a pretty high electricity bill. It's often doesn't worth the hassle. A web hosting provider also provides a domain name for
                your website.
            </p>

            </q>
            <h3>What is a domain name?</h3>
			<p>
                A domain name is your unique website name, which users use to access your website. browebgen.uk is the domain name of 
                my website. Instead of having random numbers (IP address) as your domain name you buy a human readable, unique name.
                While, computers use IP addresses, for finding and identifying computers on the Internet humans use that additional, 
                more comprehensible and memorable layer of address to find websites on the Internet. 
            </p>
            
            <q>
				A domain name is your unique website name, which users use to access your website.
            </q>

			<h3>Why do you need a web host?</h3>
			<p>
                Given what's written above you need a web host to get your website files uploaded on a server maintained by your web host so
                that the server can serve clients (visitors of your website) 24/7. Some of them can also provide you with your unique domain name.
                That's what you pay them for on a monthly basis. 
            </p>
            <h3>Where do I deploy and how much does web hosting cost?</h3>
            <p>
                Having explanation of server and web hosting out of the way lets look at the cloud based web hosts. 
                I host browebgen.uk on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/pricing" target="_blank">Heroku</a> cloud hosting for free because my webiste is
                lightweight, despite the fact that it has a database. As you can see below a brochure website with a couple of forms can be hosted for free.
                However, it can cost you quite a bit depending on a monthly website traffic, bandwidth consumed and which database or
                storage options your website uses. In this case we're talking about heavy lifting e-commerce websites or sophysticated web apps.
                Due to particularity of the technology I'm using I can deploy websites
                on the following additional cloud web hosting providers:

            <h3>Where do I get my domain name from and how much does it cost?</h3>
			<p>
                The price of a domain name very much depends on the type of domain name you use. 
                Whether you choose ".com", ".co.uk" or ".uk" suffix will determine how much you pay, so will it's length.  
                The table below represents a small sample of randomly selected registrars in the UK just to give you an idea of how much having 
                your domain name will cost you per month. You're welcome to make your own choice as there are many more registrars out there. 
                Also, since most prices are not static you may see slightly higher prices once you visit their websites.
