			<h1>On web hosting and domains</h1>
			<p>
				I first would like to mention that this article is about UK servers, however it doesn't mean that
				I can't create and put your website live if you're based in a different country. While the topic on whether 
				your website host has to be in the same country as your target audience deserves a separate blog 
				it's better to use domestic hosting and domain. At least because it ensures faster load speed of your website.

			<h3>What is a server?</h3>
			<p>
                You might have seen in movies these big rooms with corridors made of blocks with hundreds of flashy indicators on them. 
                What they didn't tell you is that these are big computers that every online service or a website relies on. These are called servers.
                A server is a piece of computer hardware, which provides functionality for other clients (programs or devices). 
                This functionality often called "services". The types of services we're talking about here are: sharing data or resources among multiple
                clients or performing computation for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers.
                A client makes a request to a server and a server serves the client by responding to the client's request. Servers, among other things, 
                store websites. Technically, every time you access a website you, as a client, make a request to a server which stores the website you're 
                trying to access. A server responds by delivering the webpages to you through your browser.
            </p>

			<h3>What is web hosting?</h3>
			<p>
                As a service web hosting allows you to post your website onto the Internet. A web host is a business that provides the technologies and
                services needed for the website or webpage to be viewed on the Internet. A web host owns and maintains servers that have to be on 24/7 so
                that your website is always available. You can purchase your server and keep it at home, but apart of paying for your server, you will need
                to deal with a pretty high electricity bill. It's often doesn't worth the hassle. A web hosting provider also provides a domain name for
                your website.

            </q>
            <h3>What is a domain name?</h3>
			<p>
                A domain name is your unique website name, which users use to access your website. BROWEBGEN.uk is the domain name of 
                my website. Instead of having random numbers (IP address) as your domain name you buy a human readable, unique name.
                While, computers use IP addresses, for finding and identifying computers on the Internet humans use that additional, 
                more comprehensible and memorable layer of address to find websites on the Internet.

            </q>

			<h3>Why do you need a web host?</h3>
			<p>
                Given what's written above you need a web host to get your website files uploaded on a server maintained by your web host so
                that the server can serve clients (visitors of your website) 24/7. They also provide you with your unique domain name.
                That's what you pay them for on a monthly basis. 
            </p>
			<h3>Some UK hosting providers and their prices.</h3>
			<p>
                Having the explanation of server and web hosting out of the way lets look at some UK web hosts and their prices as of 2020.
                The table below represents a small sample of randomly selected web hosting providers in the UK just to give you an idea of how much having 
                your website will cost you per month. You're welcome to make your own choice as there are many more hosting providers out there. 
                Also, since most prices are not static you may see slightly higher prices once you visit the web hosting provider's website. Generally,
                you can get away with a minimum price for your brochure website as this kind of website is lightweight. The prices are higher for 
                bigger businesses as they require more sophisticated websites that have e-commerce functionality, a lot more pages or, perhaps, connected to a database.
